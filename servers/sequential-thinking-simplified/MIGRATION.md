# Migration Guide: Sequential Thinking Server

## From Bloated (13,441 lines) to Simplified (821 lines)

### What Changed

#### ✅ Kept (Core Value)
- 6 decomposition strategies (top_down, bottom_up, divide_conquer, incremental, parallel, iterative)
- Problem analysis and type detection
- Strategy selection logic
- Basic Memory integration for pattern learning
- Basic Filesystem integration for artifact generation

#### ❌ Removed (Unnecessary Complexity)
- Multi-client session management (696 lines)
- Locking mechanisms and conflict resolution (779 lines)  
- Event systems and monitoring (507 lines)
- Session persistence beyond basic patterns (862 lines)
- Progressive restoration (655 lines)
- Complex validation engines (764 lines)
- 15+ extra MCP tools (only kept `decompose_problem`)

### Key Differences

| Feature | Bloated Version | Simplified Version |
|---------|-----------------|-------------------|
| **Lines of Code** | 13,441 | 821 |
| **Files** | 24 | 5 |
| **MCP Tools** | 16+ | 1 |
| **Dependencies** | Complex client management | Just MCP SDK |
| **Focus** | Distributed systems framework | Problem decomposition |

### Migration Steps

1. **Update Configuration**
   - Replace `sequential-thinking` with `sequential-thinking-simplified` in your MCP config
   - Remove any tool calls except `decompose_problem`

2. **API Changes**
   - Single tool interface remains the same
   - Removed tools: save_session, load_session, resolve_conflicts, etc.
   - Response structure simplified but core fields preserved

3. **Integration Changes**
   - Memory integration is now fire-and-forget (no complex state sync)
   - Filesystem integration generates artifacts without complex workspace management

### Benefits of Simplification

- **Maintainability**: 94% less code to maintain
- **Performance**: Faster startup, lower memory usage
- **Clarity**: Clear single purpose - problem decomposition
- **Reliability**: Less complexity = fewer bugs
- **Compatibility**: Easier to update with MCP protocol changes

### When to Use Each Version

**Use Simplified Version (Recommended) when:**
- You need cognitive problem decomposition
- You want a maintainable, focused tool
- Performance and simplicity matter

**Keep Bloated Version only if:**
- You absolutely need multi-client concurrent access (unlikely in MCP context)
- You require complex session persistence (consider using Memory server instead)
- You need conflict resolution (reconsider your architecture)

### Example Usage (Unchanged)

```javascript
const result = await tools.decompose_problem({
  problem_description: "Build a REST API",
  strategy: "top_down",
  depth_limit: 5
});
```

The simplified version provides the same core functionality with 94% less complexity.
