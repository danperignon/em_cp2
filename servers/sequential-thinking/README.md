# Sequential Thinking MCP Server

Advanced cognitive reasoning server providing structured problem-solving, adaptive strategy selection, and persistent state management for the EM_CP2 ecosystem.

## Features

### üß† Core Capabilities

- **Reasoning Chains**: Generate step-by-step logical reasoning with confidence scoring
- **Memory Integration**: Learn from previous solutions and recommend optimal strategies
- **Artifact Generation**: Create comprehensive documentation and templates via Filesystem integration
- **Cognitive Workspace**: Coordinate multi-server problem-solving workflows

### üõ† MCP Tools
- `decompose_problem` - Break complex problems into sequential steps with integrated learning

### üìä MCP Resources
- `thinking://current_state` - Live problem-solving state with integration status
- `thinking://pattern_library` - Reusable problem-solving templates and strategies
- `thinking://quality_metrics` - Solution quality assessment criteria

### üí¨ MCP Prompts  
- `analyze_problem_structure` - Cognitive pattern-based problem analysis
- `generate_solution_strategy` - Strategic planning with memory insights
- `validate_reasoning_chain` - Quality validation and improvement recommendations

## Architecture

### 3-Layer Integrated Design
1. **Core Engine** - Problem decomposition with 6 strategies and validation
2. **Integration Layer** - Memory learning and Filesystem artifact generation
3. **MCP Interface** - Tools, resources, and prompts for client interaction

### Problem-Solving Strategies
- **Top-Down**: Start broad, refine details (analytical problems)
- **Bottom-Up**: Build from components (creative problems)
- **Divide & Conquer**: Split into independent parts (complex problems)
- **Incremental**: Progressive elaboration (procedural problems)
- **Parallel**: Simultaneous workstreams (research problems)
- **Iterative**: Refine through cycles (optimization problems)

## Installation

### From EM_CP2 Monorepo
```bash
# Build the server
cd servers/sequential-thinking
pnpm build

# Test the server
node dist/index.js
```

### MCP Configuration

#### Claude Desktop
Add to `~/.claude_desktop_config.json`:
```json
{
  "mcpServers": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./servers/sequential-thinking/dist/index.js"],
      "env": {
        "THINKING_MODE": "adaptive",
        "MAX_REASONING_DEPTH": "5"
      }
    }
  }
}
```

#### Claude Code
```bash
claude mcp add sequential-thinking "node ./servers/sequential-thinking/dist/index.js"
```

#### Cline/VSCode
Add to VSCode settings or `cline_mcp_settings.json`:
```json
{
  "cline.mcp.alwaysEnabled": true,
  "cline.mcp.serverSettings": {
    "sequential-thinking": {
      "command": "node",
      "args": ["./servers/sequential-thinking/dist/index.js"]
    }
  }
}
```

## Usage Examples

### Basic Problem Decomposition
```javascript
// Decompose a complex problem with integrated learning
const result = await tools.decompose_problem({
  problem_description: "Build a real-time chat application with React and Node.js",
  depth_limit: 8
});

// Returns complete reasoning state with:
// - Structured problem decomposition
// - Memory insights and strategy recommendations  
// - Generated artifacts (markdown, JSON, templates)
// - Quality assessment and confidence scores
```

### Cognitive Workspace Workflow
```javascript
// 1. Problem Analysis with Memory Learning
const result = await tools.decompose_problem({
  problem_description: "Optimize database performance for e-commerce platform"
});

// 2. Automatic Strategy Selection (based on memory)
// Memory may recommend 'divide_conquer' based on similar problems

// 3. Artifact Generation
// Creates workspace with:
// - solution-overview.md (comprehensive analysis)
// - step-by-step-guide.md (execution instructions)
// - reasoning-state.json (complete data export)
// - reusable-template.md (for similar problems)
// - steps/ directory (individual step artifacts)

// 4. Pattern Storage for Future Learning
// Automatically stores successful patterns for future recommendations
```

### Advanced Integration Examples
See `docs/integration-examples.md` for comprehensive workflows including:
- Memory-enhanced problem solving
- Multi-strategy testing and optimization
- Complex software development scenarios
- Research and analysis integration patterns
