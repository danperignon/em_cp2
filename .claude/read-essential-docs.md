# Read Essential EM_CP2 Documentation

Load the minimal essential context for EM_CP2 development by reading these 3 core documents:

## Essential Documentation (3 files)

1. **CLAUDE.md** - Read the project memory and current context
   - Quick project overview and current state
   - Active servers and their purposes
   - Key architectural decisions

2. **docs/anti-bloat-guidelines.md** - Read and internalize the core development principles
   - Single responsibility pattern
   - Size limits (<1,000 lines per server)
   - Sequential Thinking case study (94% reduction)
   - Red flags to avoid

3. **docs/roadmap.md** - Read the living development timeline
   - Current development progress
   - Decision history and rationale
   - Active servers and their status

## Purpose
This command loads only the essential context needed for most EM_CP2 tasks, following anti-bloat principles by reducing context load by 62.5% compared to reading all documentation.

## When to Use
- Quick bug fixes or small features
- Understanding project philosophy
- Checking current development status
- Working on existing servers
